        <p class="lead text-justify">“I have been going to Kristin for over a year now. I am in my seventies and have had scoliosis all my life. In 2018 my back really started to bother me so I had an x-ray that showed a 64 degree curve. On the advice of my family doctor I tried conventional Physical Therapy for more than a year and nothing helped. In fact, my back was getting worse and I started getting spasms.</p>
        <p class="lead text-justify">So I went to an orthopedic surgeon who told me that except for PT there was nothing else he could do for the curve because he did not recommend surgery for a person my age. He gave me a list of Physical Therapists who use the Schroth Method. Since my back wasn’t getting better and my life was very limited because of it, I decided to go to Kristin Romeo, a Physical Therapist who uses the Schroth Method.</p>
        <p class="lead text-justify">On my first visit with Kristin I was really nervous and depressed about my back and my future. Kristin gave me hope and taught me breathing and strengthening exercises for my back. My back has been much, much better and I have not had any more spasms. I do the exercises she gives me everyday before I get out of bed in the morning and I am ready to go.</p>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Kristin restored my confidence that I can walk again without pain and helped me be hopeful about the future. I do believe she is my 'Schroth Angel'. Kristin has my back.”</p>
