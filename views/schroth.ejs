Patients with curves below 10 degrees are closely monitored and screened monthly at the clinic. Caregivers are educated on looking for signs of progression and postural exercises are provided for the home.  Patients with curves greater than 10 degrees are encouraged to participate in a full treatment program to minimize the risk of curve progression.

            <p class="lead">
                The Schroth method exercises are designed to address the 3 dimensional nature of scoliosis and are curve specific for each individual. It is currently the recommended method of treatment for Scoliosis by the Society on Scoliosis Orthopedic Rehabilitation and Treatment (SOSORT) and becoming the gold standard of conservative physical therapy care for those with Scoliosis and Kyphosis.
