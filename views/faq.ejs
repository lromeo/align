                    <h1 class="text-center text-md-left">Follow Ups</h1>

                    <p>
                        All follow-up treatments are one-on-one with an Advanced Certified Schroth Therapist. All treatments are unique to each individual patient as no two patientâ€™s curves are the same.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The amount of follow up treatment varies depending on many factors such as pain, age, risk of curve progression, body awareness and learning retention however a recommendation for treatment frequency and duration will be discussed at the end of your initial evaluation. The standard recommendation is for 6 to 10 follow-up sessions to be able to perform all exercises properly at home.

                    <p>
                        At this time we do not accept insurance. This allows us to sustain the 1:1 treatment model to give you the care you deserve rather than spending time dealing with insurance companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon request patients will be provided with a receipt with all appropriate documentation needed to submit to their insurance companies for reimbursement. The amount you receive is completely dependent on your individual plan however if you have out-of-network benefits covering outpatient physical therapy you should be eligible for reimbursement.
