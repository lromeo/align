                        <h1 id="about-align-scoliosis">Align Scoliosis</h1> <p>was founded in Hoboken, NJ with the goal of increasing access to conservative scoliosis care for people of all ages. It is proudly a Physical Therapist owned and operated company.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are an outpatient physical therapy clinic that treats a wide variety of physical ailments with a specialization in orthopedics and the treatment of scoliosis with the Schroth Method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All treatment sessions are one on one. Unlike most other clinics, we DO NOT treat multiple patients at once. Your session will always start on time and you will have the undivided attention of your therapist throughout the length of your visit. This ensures the best possible level of care and rehabilitation potential. This is what sets our patients up for success!
