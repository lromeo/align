            <h1 class="text-center text-md-left">Follow Ups</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                All follow-up treatments are one-on-one with an Advanced Certified Schroth Therapist. All treatments are unique to each individual patient as no two patient’s curves are the same.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The amount of follow up treatment varies depending on many factors such as pain, age, risk of curve progression, body awareness and learning retention however a recommendation for treatment frequency and duration will be discussed at the end of your initial evaluation. The standard recommendation is for 6 to 10 follow-up sessions to be able to perform all exercises properly at home.
